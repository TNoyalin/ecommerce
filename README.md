Simple E-Commerce project
I have successfully developed a comprehensive e-commerce system that enables the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD) of products while seamlessly handling product images. 
To achieve this, I utilized Spring Boot for the backend, AngularJS for the frontend, and the MySQL database
For front i used 4200 port as default.
